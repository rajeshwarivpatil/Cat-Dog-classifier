# 🐾 Cat vs Dog Image Classifier

A simple deep learning project using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with **Keras** and **TensorFlow** to classify images of cats and dogs.

## 🚀 What This Project Does
- Trains a CNN model to identify whether an image contains a **cat** or a **dog**
- Uses a cleaned dataset from Google (`cats_and_dogs_filtered`)
- Built and run in **Google Colab**
- Can be opened and tested via Colab directly from this repo

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow + Keras
- Google Colab
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
